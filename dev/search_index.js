As we don't want to have straight edges that cross each other, a flip can only be done if the quadrilateral is convex and no three of its corners lie on the same line. As we are interested in taking this theory to closed surfaces, where we will no longer have the restriction of edges being straight, we will only consider triangulations of points in convex general position.
